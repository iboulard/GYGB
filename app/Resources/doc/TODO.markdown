1. Steps
 - add new steps
     - what to use for titles?
     	- Jeff's idea: alliterative catchy titles (Try Out TCAT, Check Out Carshare)
     	- sounds like advertisments, they don't need to be this short
     	- don't need to be exciting - that's what the videos and stories are for!
	
2. Videos	
 - Community
     - new tab, default tab
     - where to put step counts?
