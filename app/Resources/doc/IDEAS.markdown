 - Tell a story
     - "I think it would be more effective to ask more detailed questions to help them tell the story.  Ask a question and then give them a text box to respond. What did you do?  What obstacles did you overcome to do it? Was it worth the effort?  Have you inspired anyone else by your step?" - Katie B
     - optional after submission?	
 - Featured individuals / organizations / nominations	
     - this will come when campaign figures this piece out
