# GYGB - README
This is the web application for the for Get Your GreenBack - Tompkins!, a county-wide campaign in Tompkins County New York that aims to educate and influence every household in the county to take a step to save money and energy.

With the website, users can find steps to take, share their steps, and see what steps others have taken.  The backend lets admins approve and feature user submitted content.

The application is built with [Symfony](http://www.symfony.com).

It can be seen live [here](http://www.getyourgreenbacktompkins.org).


## "Broken Windows" - areas for improvment
### featured content
The system for featuring content on the home page, community page, and resources page is complete, but confusing.  It allows admins to feature resources on the home page, and the resources page, and to feature submitted steps/commitments on the community page.

Once we as a campaign get a better sense of how the mature site will be organized (specifically in terms of content and featured content) and of who on the team will be using the admin site, we will return to these features for improvement.
