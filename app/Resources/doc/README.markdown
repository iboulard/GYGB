# GYGB - README
The [website](http://www.getyourgreenbacktompkins.org) for this county-wide campaign has a Symfony front and backend.  Users can find steps to take to save money and energy, share their steps, and see what steps others have taken.  The backend lets admin approve and feature user submitted content.
