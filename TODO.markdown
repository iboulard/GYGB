Get Your Greenback - TODO
======================================
	
on rollout
===============
	change feature resource page values from "take a step" to "resource guide"

	
Issues
==============
	
	- fix remember me
		
	- fill out registration form after submission
	
	- what to do with filters when searching?

	- step model problem
	
		- add m2m field on admin
		
	- remove or fix + button on M2M tool
	
		- likely need a branch of SonataDoctrineOrm
			
	- step submission deletion
	
		- cascade properly
		
		
Ideas
===========

	- Tell a story
			I think it would be more effective to ask more detailed questions to help them tell
			the story.  Ask a question and then give them a text box to respond.
			What did you do?  What obstacles did you overcome to do it? 
			Was it worth the effort?  Have you inspired anyone else by your step? - Katie B
	
			- optional after submission
	
	
	- Featured individuals / organizations
	
		- will come when coalition figures this piece out
		
		highlight photos, videos, text of community member doing it right
		
		- add to community page
		
		- add to home page
